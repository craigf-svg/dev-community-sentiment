        <h3>Initial Commit</h3>
        <p>
            The path ahead is unfamiliar, but my feet know it well, worn by years of search and the weight of a thousand
            unanswered questions. My staff hums with an energy that vibrates in my bones, as if it too knows we are
            close.
            The Flask is no myth, it is the key to everything I have sought in my long, weary life.
            The land around me feels‚Ä¶ alive, as though it recognizes my purpose and is testing me.
            The mountains murmur in tongues I almost understand, and the rivers sing songs of forgotten realms.
            There is danger here, but it matters little. I will find it. I must.
            For once I drink from that flask, the universe will bare itself to me, and no shadow, no riddle, will ever
            again
            haunt my steps.
        </p>
        <p>
            And I will become the master of my own fate, the architect of my own destiny. Builder of flask server.
